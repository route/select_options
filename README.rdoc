= Select Options

This gem creates a select tag and a series of contained option tags for the provided object and method.
Helper takes options from model's constant and translates it according to the translations file (`composite_attributes` section).

= Installation

In Gemfile:
  gem 'select_options'

= Usage example

For example with @user:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ROLES = %w(admin user)
    ...
  end

in the template:
  <%= f.select_with_options :role %>

Translations in en.yml for an ActiveRecord child look like this:
  en:
    activerecord:
      composite_attributes:
        user:
          role:
            admin: Administrator
            user: User

This code will generate translated collection of options for select tag:
  <select name="user[role]">
    <option value="admin" selected="selected">Administrator</option>
    <option value="user">User</option>
  </select>
