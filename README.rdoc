= Select Options

This gem creates a select tag and a series of contained option tags for the provided object and method.
Helper takes options from model's constant and translates it according to the translations file (`composite_attributes` section).

= Installation

In Gemfile:
  gem 'select_options'

= Usage example

For example, you have a model User with the field role and a constant ROLES:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ROLES = %w(admin user)
    ...
  end

in the template you have just write:
  <%= f.select_with_options :role %>

In case if you have the constant, named differt from the field name, like this:
  class Shape < ActiveRecord::Base
    DIMENTION_VALUES = [2, 3]
    ...
  end
in the template you should use option :source
  <%= f.select_with_options :dimention, :source => Shape::DIMENTION_VALUES %>

Translations in en.yml for an ActiveRecord child look like this:
  en:
    activerecord:
      composite_attributes:
        user:
          role:
            admin: Administrator
            user: User
or like this:
  en:
    activerecord:
      attributes:
        shape:
          dimention_2: 2D
          dimention_3: 3D

This code will generate translated collection of options for select tag:
  <select name="user[role]">
    <option value="admin" selected="selected">Administrator</option>
    <option value="user">User</option>
  </select>
